      <h1>Test 2 - Instructions</h1>
      <p>Create an if...else structure that checks whether the machine is switched on and puts a message into the response variable if it isn't, telling the user to switch the machine on.</p>
      <p>Inside the first, you need to nest an if...else if...else that puts appropriate messages into the response variable depending on what the value of score is — if the machine is turned on.</p>
      <p>The different conditional tests (and resulting responses) are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Score of less than 0 or more than 100 — "This is not possible, an error has occurred."</li>
          <li>Score of 0 to 19 — "That was a terrible score — total fail!"</li>
          <li>Score of 20 to 39 — "You know some things, but it\'s a pretty bad score. Needs improvement."</li>
          <li>Score of 40 to 69 — "You did a passable job, not bad!"</li>
          <li>Score of 70 to 89 — "That\'s a great score, you really know your stuff."</li>
          <li>Score of 90 to 100 — "What an amazing score! Did you cheat? Are you for real?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After you've entered your code, try changing machineActive to true, to see if it works.</p>
